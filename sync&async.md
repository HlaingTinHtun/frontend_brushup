# Synchronous Communication
If two processes are running Synchronously, it means that second process will wait until or unless first process complete.
Synchronous Transmission is efficient, reliable and is used for transferring a large amount of data. It provides real-time communication between connected devices. Chat Rooms, Video Conferencing, telephonic conversations, as well as face to face interactions, are some of the examples of Synchronous Transmission.

# Asynchronous Communication
If two processes are running Asynchronously, it means second process will not wait for second process result and will be executed.
It is simple, fast, economical and does not require a 2-way communication. Letters, emails, forums, televisions and radios are some of the examples of Asynchronous Transmission.
